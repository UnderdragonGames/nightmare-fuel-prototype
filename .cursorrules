- Use Bun as the runtime and package manager for this project
- All npm/node commands should use `bun` instead (e.g., `bun install`, `bun run`, `bun add`)
- Bun can run TypeScript directly, so no need for tsx or compilation steps for development
- When creating scripts or running commands, prefer Bun's native capabilities
